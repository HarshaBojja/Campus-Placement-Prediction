Placement of students is one of the most important objectives of an educational institution. Reputation and yearly admissions of an institution invariably depend on the placements it provides it students with. Institutions make great efforts to achieve placements for their students’. This will always be helpful to the institution. The objective is to predict the students getting placed for the current year by analyzing the data collected from previous year’s students. This model is proposed with an algorithm to predict the same. The data has been collected by the institution for which prediction is going to be done and by applying suitable data pre-processing techniques. This model is prepared by using Support Vector Machine [SVM] algorithm. This algorithm independently predict the results and we then compare the efficiency of the algorithm, which is based on the dataset. This model will help the placement cell to focus on the potential students and help them to improve their technical and social skills.
  Campus placement prediction is useful for the students and as well as educational institutions. It predicts weather the student get placed or not based on the marks and other criteria. Even there is this uncertainty among students about placements if we predict then this will not only give the students a heads up but will also motivate them to work harder and seek help from teachers and others in time. In this project, we consider a placement dataset and try to predict whether a candidate will be placed or not based on his/her past records with the help of Machine Learning. The problem statement was to build ML models that will correctly classify whether a student is placed or not, compare them and find the best model for the classification.
